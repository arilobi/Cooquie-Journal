# Online-Journal Application - COOQUIE
## By Marion Nabulobi

Cooquie is a full-stack journal application designed to give users a calm, intuitive space to capture their thoughts. It pairs a smooth, responsive interface with a secure and efficient backend, creating a seamless journaling experience from end to end.

## Overview
The frontend is crafted with React, using the Context API to manage shared state across the application. On the backend, Flask, Python, and SQLAlchemy work together to handle data persistence, authentication, and all server-side operations.

The interface gracefully adapts to any screen size — desktop, tablet, or mobile — ensuring that users can journal comfortably wherever they are.

## Features
It only has one role: The Client.

The Client can:
- View all the entries.
- Create an entry.
- Write, edit and delete their entries in real time.
- Register an account and log in using JWT Authentication for security and privacy.
- Update their user profile.

## Technologies used
Since this is a Front-end project, I used the technologies below:
- Backend
  - FLASK
  - PYTHON
  - SQLALCHEMY
    
- Frontend
    - REACT
    * Used to build a dynamic, component-driven UI.
    * Reusable components (navigation bar, footer, cards, etc.) ensure a cohesive and consistent design across the app.
