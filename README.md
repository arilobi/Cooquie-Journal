# Online-Journal Application - COOQUIE
## By Marion Nabulobi

Cooquie is a full-stack web applicaton that allows users to journal their thoughts through a user-friendly interface. 

The frontend of the application is built using React, leveraging the Context API to handle shared states while the backend is built using flask and python with SQLAlchemy.

Additionally, the interface is <strong>responsive</strong>, adapting smoothly to different screen sizes; whether viewed on desktop, tablet or a mobile device. 

## Features
It only has one role: The Client.

The Client can:
- View all the entries.
- Create an entry.
- Write, edit and delete their entries in real time.
- Create an account and log in.
- Update their profile.

## Technologies used
Since this is a Front-end project, I used the technologies below:
- Backend
  - FLASK, PYTHON AND SQLALCHEMY
    
- Frontend
    - REACT
    * The JavaScript Library enabled me to create a dynamic and responsive user interface. Additionally, building reusable components such as navigation bars, footers, and more to ensure consistency throughout the application.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository to your VS Code.
2. Navigate to `cd frontend`
3. Run the command, `npm install` in your VS Code terminal.
